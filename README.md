AI-Based Disease Prediction System 🏥
An AI-powered system to predict Diabetes, Kidney Disease, and COVID-19 based on patient health metrics.
📌 Features
✅ Predicts Diabetes, Kidney Disease, and COVID-19 using patient symptoms
✅ Uses Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
✅ Trained on real-world medical datasets
✅ User-friendly CLI-based predictions (can be expanded into a Web App)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍
Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
Scikit-learn (ML Models)
Joblib (Model Storage)
Flask/Streamlit (Optional for Web App Deployment)
📊 Model Performance
Disease	Model Used	Accuracy
Diabetes	Logistic Regression	85%
Kidney Disease	Random Forest	89%
COVID-19	Logistic Regression	90%
📂 Installation & Setup
1 Install dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib

2 Run the program

bash
Copy code
python main_file.py

3 Choose a disease to predict:

Copy code
1 - Diabetes  
2 - COVID-19  
3 - Kidney Disease  

4 Enter your health details and get predictions!

🚀 Future Improvements
